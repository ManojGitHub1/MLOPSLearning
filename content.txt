1. Class and object.
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
3. Why Python is called OOPS?
    Everything in Python is an object (data structure, data type, etc)

4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > you can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab

5. End to end project (chatbook class)
    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static methods

6. Inheritance
    > why - code reuseability, parent has no access to child
    > what gets inherited - Constructor, non private attr/methods
    > Constructor overloading & method overloading
    > Super keyword(can be used only inside child class, can not access var/attr)

    > Types - Single, Multiple(Diamond problem), Multilevel, Hierarchical, Hybrid

7. Extra
    > magic methods
    > decorator
    > garbage collector
    > generator and iterator
